# LIVE PROJECT

### INTRODUCTION

For the last two weeks, I worked with others in a team developing a Web Application in C#. Because much of the site had already been built, there were also a good deal of front end stories that needed to be completed, varying in difficulty. Over the two week sprint I also had the opportunity to work on some other project management and team programming skills that I'm confident I will use in the future.

Below are descriptions of a story I worked on, along with code snippets and photos.

## FRONT END 

### PHOTO MARGIN
I was task with editing the margin of the link of the photos in the production page of the project.

The extra margin space (see the orange bar above the photo) was too far up from the acutal and needed to be shorten.
The first thing I did was open the project up and run inspect to find the problem.

I eventually found that bootstrap css .mt-5 was the problem and delete it in visual studio.

After deleting the .mt-5 the margin on the page were too close to each other, so that had to change.

To fix that I add .pt-5 in the div class in order to fix the margin and the empty space link.

## OTHER SKILLS LEARNED:

* Improving project flow by communicating about who needs to check out which files for their current story.

* Taking time to ask for help and not wasting time, slowing down project work flow.
